## PART 9: Reflection Questions

### 1. What is the difference between commit and push?
- **Commit** – saves your changes on your own computer (local repository). It's like saving a draft.
- **Push** – uploads your committed changes to the online repository, on this activity we have gitea, so others can see them as well.

### 2. Why are branches important?
Branches are important because they allow you to:
- Work on new features or ideas without affecting the main code
- Let multiple people work on the same project at the same time
- Experiment safely since changes are separated from the main branch

### 3. What causes merge conflicts?
Merge conflicts happen when:
- Two or more people edit the same part of a file
- Git cannot automatically decide which change to keep when merging
